##Compile TypeScript with SublimeText + SublimeSocket + Node.js + tsc


This feature depends on **node.js** and these packages.

* ws
* tail
* typescript

Also depends on SublimeSocket(This repo).


##ready project folder:
This feature compiles *.ts which are located in the **single folder by default**.

And you need to prepare empty "tscompile.log" file in the folder too.

	sample/
		*.ts
		
		tscompile.log //<- need it!
		
If you wanna compile more huge project, you can modify **tscwithenv.sh**.


##troubleShooting

1.compile never end:
	
	Maybe the path of tsc is wrong.
	By default the tsc path is defined as "/usr/local/bin/tsc" in the tscwithenv.sh .
	You should change it.
